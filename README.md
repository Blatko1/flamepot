# flamepot

`flamepot` is a Minecraft Datapack which adds a new types of potion called `Potion of Flames`. Main function of these potions is setting players, mobs and entities on fire.

### Future:

- try replacing data and NBT tags and selectors

- add *summon functions* and */trigger* commands

- maybe: remove Burning effect on rain

- add an item which spawns an entity which constantly sets on fire everything in radius

- maybe: reduce duration of effect is entity is further from splash center
